Raydium CPMM Sniper Bot

Short: A high-level README for a Raydium CPMM sniper project.
This document is intentionally non-actionable: it explains architecture, risks, defenses, and developer considerations without providing exploitative or malicious implementation details.

Project overview

A Raydium CPMM Sniper monitors the Solana chain (or indexing streams) for Raydium Constant-Product Market Maker (CPMM) events such as new pool creation or the first liquidity add, and aims to submit low-latency trades to capture early price moves. This README describes the system architecture, tradeoffs, and safe development practices. It intentionally omits implementation steps that would enable opportunistic or harmful front-running behaviour.

Goals & scope

Informational: explain how a sniper system is structured and what components are required.

Research & defensive: help projects understand how snipers operate so they can design safer launches.

Not included: step-by-step exploit code, mempool relaying mechanics for front-running, or automated strategies designed to harm projects or other users.

High-level architecture

Event Monitor — listens for on-chain Raydium AMM events (pool creation, liquidity additions).

Decision Engine — applies rules & heuristics to decide whether to attempt a trade.

Transaction Builder — constructs the transaction(s) required to interact with Raydium AMM (swap / add liquidity), with proper PDAs and accounts.

Execution Layer — sends transactions using the fastest available RPC / bundler / priority service.

Observability & Logging — tracks events, latencies, success/failure, P&L.

Risk Controls — limits (max slippage, max amount), blacklists, kill-switches.

Components & responsibilities

Indexer / Stream (preferred)

Fast source of events (websocket, RPC logs, or an indexer).

Often required to detect pool creation or the first add_liquidity instruction quickly.

Validator / Filter

Validate token lists, contract addresses, owner checks to avoid interacting with malicious contracts.

Strategy / Decision Engine

Rules for when to attempt a purchase (e.g., min liquidity, max price impact, token whitelist).

Rate-limiting to avoid excessive failures.

Transaction Composer

Correctly constructs the instructions to call Raydium AMM (swap instruction or add_liquidity approach).

Correctly derives any PDAs used by the program.

Execution / Relay

Submits transaction to RPC or specialized relayer (if used).

Monitors finality and handles retries/timeouts.

Monitoring Dashboard

Latency metrics, success/failure rates, open positions, and alerts.

Data sources & infra

RPC providers — low-latency endpoints (e.g., private nodes, RPC pools).

Indexers/Streams — e.g., real-time log streaming or third-party indexers for faster event detection.

Optional priority services — relayer or bundler networks (note: using third-party transaction acceleration can be costly and may have legal/ethical implications).

Metrics/Logging — Prometheus/Grafana, centralized logging, Sentry.

Typical workflow (conceptual)

Indexer emits event: Raydium pool created or liquidity added.

Monitor filters events against strategy criteria (token whitelist, liquidity threshold).

Decision engine calculates desired size and acceptable slippage.

Transaction builder composes swap instruction(s) with expected PDAs and accounts.

Execution layer sends transaction with appropriate recent blockhash and signatures.

Observability captures success/failure and updates metrics.
